## TODO APP

_SO ANOTHER TODO LIST?!_
THERE IS ONE DIFFERENCE IN IT

### INTENT

Well, I was learning a new query language
For this reason, I decided to consolidate my knowledge with a small practice project. What's better than a small project to start?

### graphql

Do you probably know him? A query language is very good
which has fundamental differences with the architecture of the REST APIs
The graph helps us to reduce the number of requests on the Internet by transferring all requests to one end point!. This is wonderful!
Also, the graph helps us to have all the data we need by just writing the desired query, that is, the data that was written even in different routes in the REST architecture in the graph writen in one route and at once according to Queries sent by the client are resolved by qraph and sent to the client!

### How Run App

easily!
just clone the repo and then run :

```bash
npm run server:start
```
